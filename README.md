  <strong>Welcome to my GitHub</strong><br>
  I like building neat, functional things.

Hi, I am Saud. I am a software development student who enjoys building things that look clean, feel intuitive and actually solve problems. I focus on frontend work and I work with backend whenever I need to complete a project. I like improving things until they look right, work well and make sense.

I enjoy learning and improving my fundamentals through Boot.dev and other online resources, especially when I want to deepen my understanding or fill in specific gaps.

I like creating small quality of life apps for myself, especially tools that help organise my day or support my training.  
One project I am excited about is a POS system I plan to build for my dad's shop. He has been using an old analogue register for years, so updating it with something modern and custom feels meaningful.

Here are the tools and technologies I use.

**💻 Languages:** React, React Native, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, CSS, HTML, SQL, C, C++, Node.js  
**🛠️ Tools and Technologies:** Figma, Expo, Vercel, VS Code, Git, GitHub, Docker, SQLite  
**🐧 Operating Systems:** I use Arch Linux by the way

A few things about me.  
• League of Legends, mostly playing ADC 🎮  
• Bouldering 🧗‍♂️  
• I can solve a Rubik's Cube in under 30 seconds and enjoy the flow of it 🧩  
• I like anime, especially One Piece 📺
