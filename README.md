I am a software development student who enjoys building things that look clean, feel intuitive and actually solve problems. I focus on frontend work and work with backend whenever I need to complete a project. I like improving things until they look right, work well and make sense.

I enjoy learning and improving my fundamentals through Boot.dev and other online resources, especially when I want to deepen my understanding or fill in specific gaps.

I like creating small quality of life apps for myself, especially tools that help organise my day or support my training.

Here are the tools and technologies I use.

Languages: React, React Native, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, CSS, HTML, SQL, C, C++, Node.js  
Tools & Technologies: Figma, Expo, Vercel, VS Code, Git, GitHub, Docker, SQLite  
Operating Systems: I use Arch btw
